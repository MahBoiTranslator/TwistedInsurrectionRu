; 29. COMPUTER IQ CONTROLS
;========================================================================================================
; Each player (computer controlled or otherwise) is given an IQ rating that is used
; to control what the computer is allowed to automatically control. This is
; distinct from the difficulty setting. The higher the IQ setting, the more autonomous
; and intelligent the side will behave. Each ability is given a rating that
; indicates the IQ level (or above) that the ability will be granted. Because such
; abilities are automatically performed by the computer, giving a human controlled
; country a high IQ is not recommended. Otherwise the player's units will start to
; automatically "do their own thing"! A human controlled country is presumed to have
; an IQ rating of zero. A computer controlled country has an IQ of 1 or higher.
; When in skirmish mode or when multiplayer AIs are active, the computer IQ is set to
; the maximum.
[IQ]
MaxIQLevels=5           ; the maximum number of discrete IQ levels
SuperWeapons=4          ; super weapons are automatically fired by computer
Production=5            ; building/unit production is automatically controlled by computer
GuardArea=2             ; newly produced units start in guard area mode
RepairSell=1            ; allowed to choose repair or sell of damaged buildings
AutoCrush=2             ; automatically try to crush antogonists if possible
Scatter=2               ; will scatter from incoming threats [grenades and such]
ContentScan=3           ; will consider contents of transport when picking good target
Aircraft=3              ; automatically replace aircraft

SellBack=2              ; allowed to sell buildings


;========================================================================================================
; 30. COLOURS
;========================================================================================================
; Each country must be assigned a color. This lists the various
; colors available. The values represent the 'hue', 'saturation',
; and 'value'. The 'value' component specifies the maximum brightness
; allowed for the color as the color spread is generated. The 'hue'
; component remains constant. The 'saturation' curves through color
; space as the 'value' component changes such that darker colors
; become more saturated.
;
; Beside the colors are internal color indexes. Even numbered colors are not listed;
; they are automatically generated duplicates which ignore alpha layers (shroud)
; and are thus unsuitable for ingame use.
;
; Third column designates hardcoded multiplayer (MP) color indexes.
;
; Fourth column shows which color IDs and/or indexes are hardcoded.
;
; This list should have no more than 100 entries (0-99).
;

; 31. DIFFICULTY SETTINGS
;========================================================================================================
; Game difficulty is controlled by these factors. Some of these factors will
; only affect a computer player.

; The computer and the player are handicapped by individual settings:
;  - When playing on Easy mode, the player's house uses the [Easy] settings, while all AI houses are handicapped according to [Difficult].
;  - When playing on Normal mode, all houses, human or AI, use the [Normal] settings.
;  - When playing on Hard mode, the player's house uses the [Difficult] settings, while all AI houses are boosted according to [Easy].

; Airspeed = multiplier to speed for all air units (def=1.0)
; Armor = multiplier to armor strength for all units and buildings (def=1.0)
; Cost = multiplier to cost for all units and buildings (def=1.0)
; Firepower = multiplier to firepower for all weapons (def=1.0)
; Groundspeed = multiplier to speed for all ground units (def=1.0)
; ROF = multiplier to Rate Of Fire for all weapons [larger means slower ROF] (def=1.0)
; BuildSlowdown = Should the computer build slower than the player (def=no)?
;  <<< affects the computer player, not the human player >>>
;    ContentScan = Should the contents of a transport be considered when picking best target (def=no)?
;    RepairDelay = average delay (minutes) between initiating building repair
;    BuildDelay = average delay (minutes) between initiating construction

; The weapons specified here are attached to the various combat
; units and buildings.

; Anim             = animation to display as a firing effect [use 8 for directional variation]
; Burst            = number of rapid succession shots from this weapon (def=1)
; BurstDelay#      = Delay between bursts [BurstDelay0-3] (def=-1, in which the delay is randomly chosen between 3 - 5)
; Camera           = Reveals area around firer (def=no)?
; Charges          = Does it have charge-up-before-firing logic (def=no)?
; Damage           = the amount of damage (unattenuated) dealt with every bullet
; Floater          = decreases gravity on the projectile by 50%
; Lobber           = does the projectile fly to target in a high arc (def=no)?
; Projectile       = projectile characteristic to use
; ROF              = delay between shots [15 = 1 second at middle speed setting]
; Range            = maximum cell range
; MinimumRange     = minimum range to target (def=0)
; ProjectileRange  = maximum distance a Ranged projectile can fly before detonating (regardless if it reaches target or not).
; Report           = List of sounds to random play when firing
; Speed            = speed of projectile to target (100 is maximum)
; Warhead          = warhead to attach to projectile
; Supress          = Should nearby friendly units be scanned for and if found, discourage firing on target (def=no)?
;                    For each friendly unit found within a distance specified by FireSupress from the target, the target's threat value is halved.
;                    If the threat value is decreased below 1, then the target will not be automatically acquired. 
; UseFireParticles = Should the weapon spawn a flame particle system? (def = no)
; Bright           = Does this weapons bullet cause a lighting effect when it impacts (def=no)? If set, this will override the warheads 'Bright' flag.
; IonSensitive     = Shuts down during an ion storm (def=no)? 
;
; For flashing muzzles, the following lines apply:
; UseSparkParticles=yes [Not if unit has a turret]
; IsRailgun=yes         [For QMove Suport]

; 34. PROJECTILE STATISTICS
;========================================================================================================
; Projectiles describe how and what image to use as the weapon flies
; to its target. Think of the projectile as the "delivery method" used
; to get the warhead to the desired target.

; AA = Can this weapon fire upon flying aircraft (def=no)?
; AG = Can this weapon fire upon ground objects (def=yes)?
; ASW = Is this an Anti-Submarine-Warfare projectile (def=no)?
; Acceleration = amount to increase missile speed (def=3)
; Airburst = Does it try to fly over the target instead of hit it (def=no)?
; Arm = arming delay, in frames (def=0)
; Bouncy      = Does it bounce a bit upon impact (def=no)?
; Degenerates = Does the bullet strength weaken as it travels (def=no)?
; Dropping    = [deprecated, makes the projectile explode immediately] Does it fall from a starting height (def=no)?
; Elasticity  = "bounciness" of the object [should be 0.0 through 1.0] (def=0.75)
; High        = Can it fly over walls (def=no)?
; Image       = image to use during flight
; Inaccurate  = Is it inherently inaccurate (def=no)?
; Inviso      = Is the projectile invisible as it travels (def=no)?
; Parachuted  = Equipped with a parachute for dropping from plane (def=no)?
; Proximity   = [obsolete] Does it blow up when near its target (def=no)?
; ROT         = Rate Of Turn [non zero implies homing] (def=0)
; Ranged      = Does this projectile blow up if it exceeds the weapon's ProjectileRange (def=no)?
; Shadow      = If High, does this bullet need to have a shadow drawn? (def = yes)
; Color       = Color scheme to use for special remapping voxel projectiles (def = none)
; VeryHigh    = Does it fly at a very high cruise altitude (def=no)?
; Cluster     = number of explosions attached to projectile [cluster-bomb] (def=1)

;========================================================================================================
;
; Particle System flags
;
; HoldsWhat     = type of particle (see below) that this system manages (required)
; BehavesLike   = defines some common attributes for this system. Valid entries are Fire, Smoke, Spark, Railgun, Gas, and WeakGas.
; Spawns        = does this system spawn particles by itself (def = no)
; SpawnFrames   = number of frames to wait before spawning another particle
; ParticleCap   = maximum number of particles that can be in this system
; Lifetime      = how long should this system exist?
; OneFrameLight = does this system create a light flash effect?
; LightSize     = size of the light flash, if enabled
; 
;
;     Flags specific to smoke particle systems
;
;     SpawnRadius             = radius, in leptons, of the area where particles are randomly distributed
;     SpawnCutoff             = how many particles must spawn until slowdown kicks in?
;     SpawnTranslucencyCutoff = how many particles must spawn until new ones become increasingly translucent?
;     Slowdown                = how fast should the particle spawn rate slow down?
;
;
;     Flags specific to railgun particle systems
;
;     ParticlesPerCoord               = number of particles to spawn per spiral coordinate
;     SpiralDeltaPerCoord             = wavelength of the spiral
;     SpiralRadius                    = radius of the spiral
;     PositionPerturbationCoefficient = random offset to initial particle position (0 means no offset from the spiral)
;     MovementPerturbationCoefficient = random offset to particle direction
;     VelocityPerturbationCoefficient = random offset to particle velocity
;     Laser                           = does this system draw a laser line?
;     LaserColor                      = what color is the laser [R,G,B]?
;
;
;     Flags specific to spark particle systems
;
;     SparkSpawnFrames     = how many frames should this system spawn spark particles for?
;     SpawnSparkPercentage = chance to actually spawn a particle during each spawn frame
;
;
; Particle flags
;
; Image              = Imagelist to use for particle
; Persistent         = Does this particle stick around; should always be yes
; MaxDC              = How many frames go by before this particle damages the things near it? (def = 0)
; MaxEC              = How many frames does this object last (def = 0)
; Damage             = How much damage does it do (def = 0)
; Warhead            = What warhead to use for damage purposes (def = WARHEAD_NONE)
; StartStateAI       = Initial state (first frame of particle animation)
; EndStateAI         = End state (last frame of particle animation)
; StateAIAdvance     = How long should pass before advancing to the next state (next frame)?
; DeleteOnStateLimit = Should the particle be removed at state limit?
; Translucent25State = At which frame should the particle animation become 25% translucent?
; Translucent50State = At which frame should the particle animation become 50% translucent?
; FinalDamageState   = After which frame should this fire particle stop dealing damage?
; StartFrame         = what frame of image to start on? (def = 0)
; NumLoopFrames      = how many frames form a single loop? (def = 1)
; NextParticle       = what particle to spawn after this one dies? (def = none)
; NextParticleOffset = spawn offset for the next particle [X,Y,Z] (def = 0,0,0)
; WindEffect         = to what degree does the wind affect his particle, 0 = not at all, 5 = a lot (def = 0)
; Velocity           = speed at which particle travels (def = 0.0)
; Radius             = how big is this particle? (used for attract/repel)

;========================================================================================================
; 36. WARHEAD CHARACTERISTICS
;========================================================================================================
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = damage spread factor [larger means greater spread] (def=1)
;          [A value of 1 means the damage is halved every pixel distant from center point (horizontally).
;           a value of 2 means damage is halved every 2 pixels, etc.
;
;           Some benchmarks:
;           0-23: the warhead can only deal full damage to the cell spot it detonates in
;           24 or larger means the warhead can deal full damage to all 4 subcells
;
;           Maximum area of effect is 3x3 cells, excluding the four corner cell spots used by infantry.
;           This creates a roughly circular area.]
; Wall = Does this warhead damage walls and bridges (def=no)?
; Wood = Does this warhead damage trees (def=no)?
; Fire = Does this warhead leave a small residual flame (def=no)?
; Tiberium = Does this warhead destroy Tiberium (def=no)?
; Sparky = Does this warhead ignite trees and buildings [using SmallFire] (def=no)?
; Conventional = Is the warhead big enough to cause a splash when it hits water (def=no)?
; Rocker = Can this warhead cause nearby units to rock upon impact (def=no)?
; AnimList = list of animations to play when warhead explodes [listed from lesser to greater damage]
;            [divide weapon damage by 25 to determine which animation to play (0-based index)]
;            [Warhead verses are ignored in the calculation, but firepower etc. bonuses are not]
; InfDeath = which infantry death animation to use (def=0)
;            [0=instant die, 1=twirl die, 2=explodes, 3=flying death, 4=burn death, 5=electro]
; Deform = % chance that this warhead will damage the ground when it hits. (def=0)
; DeformThreshhold = damage must exceed this amount before deformation can occur (def=0)
; Particle = Particle effect to use when explosion occurs (def=none)
; ProneDamage = Damage modifer for infantry when prone (def=1.0)
;               [also used against JumpJet infantry with Fearless=no]
; Bright = Does this warhead normally cause a lighting effect when it goes off (def=no). This is overridden in the case of bullets by the weapon 'Bright' flag.
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of full damage)...
;           -vs- none, wood, light armor, heavy armor, concrete armor
; LimpetFactor = Latches the firer to the target, slowing it down by this percentage (100 completely immobilizes the target) (def=0)

; 37. TERRAIN OBJECTS
;========================================================================================================
; This section lists all the terrain object types and
; specifies their characteristics.

; Immune         = Is the terrain immune to combat damage (def=no)?
; WaterBound     = Is the terrain only allowed on the water (def=no)?
; SpawnsTiberium = Does it spawn growth of Tiberium around it (def=no)?
; IsFlammable    = Can "Forest Fires" spread to and damage this terrain type? [obsolete]
; Crushable      = Can this terrain type be driven over by heavy vehicles (def=no)?
; YDrawFudge     = Fudge, in pixels, to apply when sorting this object in it's layer [- up, + down] (def=0).
; TemperateOccupationBits = Bit field to determine which cell spot(s) on this terrain can be occupied by infantry in temperate theater:
;                           0 = no spots blocked
;                           1 = spot 2 (east) blocked
;                           2 = spot 3 (west) blocked
;                           3 = spots 2 and 3 blocked
;                           4 = spot 4 (south) blocked
;                           5 = spots 2 and 4 blocked
;                           6 = spots 3 and 4 blocked
;                           7 = all spots blocked
; SnowOccupationBits = Same as TemperateOccupationBits, except for snow theater.

; to use when this crate is picked up. The third parameter, if present, specifies
; the data value needed for that crate powerup. They mean different things
; for the different powerups.

; Note if you change these, make sure to change NoBaddieCrates.ini as well

; 43. MISSION CONTROL
;========================================================================================================
; This specifies the various general behavior characteristics of
; the missions that objects can be assigned. Each of the game objects must
; be in a mission. The mission behavior is generally hard coded into
; the program, but there are some behavior characteristics that can
; be overridden. Don't modify these.

; NoThreat = Is its weapons disabled and thus ignored as a potential target until fired upon (def=no)?
; Zombie = Is forced to sit there like a zombie and never recovers (def=no)?
; Recruitable = Can it be recruited into a team or base defense (def=yes)?
; Paralyzed = Is the object frozen in place but can still fire and function (def=no)?
; Retaliate = Is allowed to retaliate while on this mission (def=yes)?
; Scatter = Is allowed to scatter from threats (def=yes)?
; Rate = delay between normal processing (larger = faster game, less responsiveness)
; AARate = anti-aircraft delay rate (if not specifed it uses regular rate).
