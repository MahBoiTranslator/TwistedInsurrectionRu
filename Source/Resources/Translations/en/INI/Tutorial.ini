3=WARNING: Nod armor detected.
;;;Nod 2nd 1/3;;;
4=Civilian: What the...our house is on fire! Quick, call the fire department!
5=Civilian: Look, they are already here! Thank goodness!
6=Incinerator: ...firefighters? Why yes...we fight with fire!
;;; Generic ;;;
7=
8=Mission Accomplished.
;;;GDI 3rd;;;
9=GDI Soldier: Shit! We've been spotted already!
10=Nod Soldier 1: Where are those engineers when you need them? We should be on the other side by now!
11=Nod Soldier 2: Watch out, GDI forces behind you!
12=GDI Soldier: Sir, take a look at this. We can see General Sheppard and the other survivors from up here.
13=General Sheppard: Good to see you here, Commander, we've been avoiding Nod troops for a while now.
14=Objective 1: Contact General Sheppard and his squad.
15=Objective 2: Escort General Sheppard to the beach.
16=Escort General Sheppard to this beach and wait for evac. He MUST be kept alive.
17=Nod Soldier: Look, GDI forces! Send the LIGHT TANKS after them!
18=Nod Engineer: Hey, you, hand me that wrench. I need to fix this bridge before the reinforcements arrive.
19=Good job, Commander. The evac hovercraft should be here any minute...
20=Captain Harden: Ten-hut! Alright troops, General Sheppard and his convoy are trapped somewhere in this region.
21=Our job is to find them before Nod does and get them home. Now move!
22=GDI Soldier: Watch out! They've got anti-infantry LASER TURRETS!
;;;GDI 2nd;;;
23=Objective: Escort the CONVOY TRUCKS safely to the city.
24=HINT: Leave the convoy at the back of your attack force as you traverse the area.
25=GloboTech Peacekeeper: Sir, this area is crawling with Nod forces, so we better act fast.
26=GDI Soldier: It'd be suicide to take on that outpost directly -- let's find another way around.
27=GloboTech Soldier: Merde, they're hiding in the trees! Take cover!
28=Convoy Driver: Nod forces are headed our way -- get to the city, now!
29=GloboTech Engineer: Nod has never entered this city and I'll be damned if they do today. Stand back!
30=GloboTech Guardian: Bonjour, sir! We've been transferred under your command for this mission.
31=We've got to escort this convoy to Chambery, sir. Without the supplies, the city will soon fall to the Nod siege.
32=WARNING: Nod FLAME TANK detected.
;;;GDI 4th;;;
33=This is one of the largest Tiberium fields we know of, and it looks like a new kind of Tiberium has evolved here...
34=We sent two airborne teams to scout the area, but while approaching the Tiberium field, their Chinook transports reported missile fire and dropped out of contact.
35=It's likely that Nod has built a base in the area to research this new strain of Tiberium. Your job is to destroy the Nod base so we can take control of the Tiberium field and halt whatever research they're conducting here.
36=Objective 1: Eliminate all Nod presence in the city.
37=These are our new KAZUAR WALKERS, designed to eliminate enemy infantry with minimal collateral damage. Use them wisely, Commander.
38=Objective 2: Destroy Nod's Tiberium research facility and base defenses.
39=GDI Soldier: Shit, they're attacking us! Get back! Get back!
40=Thank you for the help, Commander. We'd better get going, that cave is crawling with those beasts.
41=GDI Soldier: Hey, look at those creatures. What are they?
42=OH GOD! AARGHH, MY LEG!
43=GDI Soldier: Thanks, Commander. I thought our goose was cooked when our transport was shot down by Nod AA. Did you find the other crash site?
;;;Pandemonium part II;;;
44=The gates of Pandemonium...
45=...SHALL OPEN!!
;;;Nod 1st;;;
46=Nod Soldier: Be careful, a turret that big must have a lot of firepower.
47=Nod Soldier: What's this? A "Blue Earth memorial"? Heresy! Demolish it!
48=Nod Soldier: Watch out! Those enemy soldiers are heavily armed!
49=Objective 1: Destroy the city and any enemy militia.
50=Buggy Operator: Come on, brothers! Let us cleanse this city, and burn its puny rebel fighters! 
51=GDI Officer: Quickly, before they see us! The city is lost, but we'll live to fight another day.
52=HINT: Destroying the POWER PLANT will shut down the city's defenses.
;;;Nod 2nd 2/3;;;
53=Nod Soldier: Look over there! That's not normal algae -- it looks like Tiberium! We'd better report this.
54=Incinerator: Watch out, they're on the cliffs! Fall back!
55=Use our INCINERATORS to smoke the enemy troops out of this forest. Burn everything to the ground and scatter the ashes!
56=Objective 1: Remove all enemy presence from the area.
57=Objective 2: Destroy the militia outpost.
58=Well done, Commander. We've located the base of this militia. Head north with these reinforcements and crush the militia base.
59=Enemy Soldier: Nod forces approaching! You -- keep an eye on the prisoners!
60=Incinerator: We'll never get through that roadblock -- let's find another way around.
61=GDI Engineer: The bridge is good to go. Let's move before they get here and see us!
;;;Nod 3rd;;;
62=Incinerator TL: FOB, this is Fire-Starter One, we're approaching th- wait... Take cover!
63=It appears the local GDI resistance is more resourceful than we anticipated. Scout the area and remove any GDI opposition you encounter.
64=Objective 1: Scout the area for GDI resistance.
65=Nod Soldier: This militia seems to be everywhere GDI is active!
66=Commander, GDI has somehow managed to build a forward base right under our noses! Destroy it before they overrun your position.
67=Use of SCORPION LIGHT TANKS has been authorized. Their armament should be enough to deal with those walkers.
68=Objective 2: Destroy all remaining GDI forces.
;;;GDI 5th;;;
69=You may find these GOLIATH HEAVY TANKS useful, Commander. Their armor and firepower are superior to our previous MBTs.
70=Welcome back to Wellspring Base, Commander. The nearby Tiberium field has provided much needed research and funding over the years.
71=Unfortunately, increasing Tiberium contamination levels and relentless attacks by Nod have made the base too costly to maintain any longer.
72=We need you to oversee and defend the harvesting operations until we've gathered enough surplus credits. The base will then be decommissioned.
73=Objective: Harvest 30,000 surplus credits.
74=GDI Soldier: Wait! I wouldn't go in there. That thing doesn't look too friendly...
;;;Sunset Vista;;;
75=Outpost Guard: Blow the bridge!
;;;Nod 4th 1/2;;;
76=Outer city defensive turrets offline.
77=Inner city defensive turrets offline.
78=GloboTech Soldier: Incoming Nod forces! Don't let them enter the city!
79=Nod Soldier: Wait, these guys are with GloboTech? Since when did those pompous arms dealers pick sides?
80=Nod Soldier: Take a look at those plants over there. Looks like Tiberium is reshaping Earth's organisms, like in Kane's prophecies!
81=Objective 1: Destroy 4 enemy Armories.
82=Objective 1: Destroy 4 GloboTech Armories.
83=Objective 2: Destroy the GDI base.
84=Objective 3: Capture the Radar Array.
85=This is a very important mission, Commander. We need to capture the resistance's RADAR ARRAY located in the heart of this heavily defended city.
86=You will first need to weaken the enemy defenses by destroying the four Armories supplying them with weapons and ammunition.
87=Beware: according to our intelligence, GDI has constructed a base around the RADAR ARRAY. Raze it to the ground.
88=Hint: Destroying the ELECTRICITY STATION and FUSION REACTORS will switch off their defensive turrets.
89=Armory destroyed.
90=Good work Commander. The enemy won't be able to attack you anymore. Now, capture that RADAR ARRAY!
91=Enemy soldier: Nod forces incoming, don't let them enter the city!
92=Now that we have captured the RADAR ARRAY, we should be able to locate the GloboTech depots.
;;;Nod 5th;;;
93=In order to destroy the GloboTech supply depot located in the canyon to the east, we need to make contact with our small airbase to the west.
94=A survey team was dispatched earlier, but contact has been severed. It is possible that the original team is still in the area somewhere. Use this small squad to search for the airbase. Try to avoid all hostile forces.
95=These are GDI's new SCATTERPACK WALKERS. They are extremely lethal to infantry -- avoid them at all costs.
96=Objective 1: Make contact with our airbase to the west.
97=Objective 2: Secure the GloboTech depot entrance.
98=Good work, Commander. Our HORNET AIRCRAFT should be very effective against the GloboTech positions if you make sure the enemy defensive turrets are offline first.
99=Flame Tank Operator: Look, our troops are heading this way!
100=GloboTech EMP batteries offline.
101=Nod Soldier: Red Tiberium? Now I've seen everything!
102=Excellent! Now with their defenses down we can send our troops into this underground depot of theirs. Please stand-by.
103=WARNING! EMP missile system detected! Lethal to aircraft!
;;;GDI covert op 1;;;
104=Incoming Nod forces! Good luck, Commander.
;;;Nod covert op 1;;;
105=Radar indicates that GDI, GloboTech, and Forsaken forces are incoming. Keep the base standing as long as possible. Good luck, brother.
106=
;;;Nod Mission 7;;;
107=Nod Soldier: The whole facility is going to blow! Move, move, move!
108=GloboTech reinforcements are almost certain to arrive any second. We had better evacuate immediately!
109=Objective 1: Return to the airbase for immediate evacuation.
110=GloboTech reinforcements detected!
111=Nod Soldier: Thanks for the help, sir. These pests are practically coming out of the damn walls!
112=Nod Soldier: Those GloboTech rats have set up a barricade.  We'd be wise to avoid it.
113=Airbase Command: Alert! GDI forces are attacking, we need backup now! Now, damn it! N..AARGH...
114=The airbase is lost, Commander. Hold tight, we're going to pinpoint a secondary location for the extraction of your forces. 
115=Nod Soldier: Where the hell are those evac coordinates!? The enemy's everywhere!
116=Warning! Heavy GDI armor detected!
117=Commander, we have located a safe route for evacuation of your forces. Coordinates: X-19, A-76, L-56.
118=New Mission Objective: Await extraction coordinates.
119=New Mission Objective: Get to the extraction point.
120=GloboTech Officer: Team Iota, this is Command. Your new orders are to leave your posts and seek and destroy Nod units in the area, effective immediately!
;;;Nod 6th 1/2;;;
121=Gate 1 unlocked
122=Gate 2 unlocked
123=Gate 3 unlocked
124=It's time to take this facility down, Commander. Search the area for information about its weak spots, then bring the roof down!
125=This facility is divided into different sections by impenetrable gates. However, your Machinists should be able to unlock them if they gain access to the Power Generators. The Machinists must survive!
126=Objective 1: Proceed through the first gate.
127=Nod Soldier: This appears to be some sort of laboratory. I thought this place was just a supply depot.
128=We've located another gate. Find out what's behind it!
129=Objective 2: Search the area behind the second gate.
130=Nod Soldier: Seriously, what the hell is going on in here? I've never seen this kind of technology before.
131=It seems we've explored the whole facility, Commander. Scanning for all structural flaws...
132=Analysis complete. We'll be sending in our new DEMOLITION DRONES through the main entrance any moment. Defend them at all costs!
133=Escort the DEMOLITION DRONES to the weak spots. They must all be in position before the detonation!
134=Objective 3: Protect the DEMOLITION DRONES.
135=DEMOLITION DRONE checkpoint reached, ready for detonation...
136=All DEMOLITION DRONES have reached their designated waypoints. Detonation in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
137=What are you waiting for, Commander?! Get your troops out of there before the whole place collapses!
138=Critical unit lost!
139=Power Generator subverted.
;;;GDI 7th;;;
140=Commander, we've received an urgent request for aid from GloboTech. One of their weapons research compounds has been captured by Nod forces.
141=This laboratory contains the blueprints and prototype of a powerful new weapon, which must be retrieved.
142=Your mission is to infiltrate the laboratory with an ENGINEER and extract the information. Your squad is arriving now.
143=The COMMANDO and the ENGINEERS are crucial to your mission. Keep them alive at all costs.
144=WARNING: Nod Obelisks detected.
145=Commando: Shit! It looks like the prototype and blueprints have been moved to another location...
146=Recon shows Nod extracting cargo from the lab and transporting it to their TECHNOLOGY CENTER to the east.
147=It's impossible to get past those defences with just the scouting party, so we're sending you an MCV. Burn that base to the ground and scatter the ashes, but be sure to capture the TECHNOLOGY CENTER and the PROTOTYPE intact.
148=Objective 1: Infiltrate the GloboTech Laboratory with an Engineer.
149=Objective 2: Destroy the Nod base.
150=Objective 3: Capture the Nod Technology Center
151=These are our new SIEGE TROOPERS. Their mortars should be perfect for bombarding the Nod base.
152=GDI Engineer: I've got the blueprints, sir. Requesting evac.
153=EVA: The dropship cannot enter the area until Nod's anti-air defenses are destroyed.
154=Prototype located. Send your ENGINEER into the lab and retrieve the documents.
155=EVA: The dropship cannot enter the area until Nod's base is destroyed.
156=Critical structure lost!
;;;GDI covert op 2;;;
157=Destroy the Nod CONTROL CENTER in every sector of the facility using only the COMMANDO. Good luck.
158=Control Center discovered.
159=Control Center destroyed - gates opening...
160=Power regulators destroyed - laser overload imminent.
161=Final Control Center discovered.
162=All sectors cleared - mission complete!
163=
;;;Nod 4th last bit;;;
164=Spearhead the assault with our new ECLIPSE HEAVY TANKS. Their Tachyon pulse cannons can pierce armor with ease.
165=
;;;WIP Text;;;
166=Mission incomplete! Proceeding to the next mission...
;;;Nod 10th 1/3;;;
167=Harvester Operator: Help, we are under attack! All the Kazuars... down, send... ...forcements!
168=Goliath Operator: Visceroids again? Hang tight, we're on our way.
169=Emerald Peak... what glorious scenery for this devious operation! We have the weather on our side, as the ion storm is causing a communications blackout between GDI and GloboTech.
170=We've been informed that this GDI harvesting facility near the peak is having difficulties defending itself against the Tiberium lifeforms in the area.
171=This is a great opportunity for us. Your mission is to capture the base and use it against GloboTech.
172=By attacking the nearby GloboTech facility with GDI's equipment, we might be able to break their alliance apart. Let our enemies fight each other!
173=You must be careful not to let any GloboTech forces spot you. Make sure you scout the area with your Black Hand soldiers before moving on.
174=Objective 1: Capture the GDI COMMUNICATIONS CENTER and harvesting facility before the ion storm ends.
175=Objective 2: Destroy the GloboTech research facility using GDI equipment.
176=WARNING! GloboTech turrets spotted!
177=GloboTech Peacekeeper: What the fuck?! Why the hell is GDI attacking us?!
178=You've been detected by GloboTech! Mission aborted!
179=The GDI officers in the Communications Center have informed GloboTech about your actions! Mission aborted!
180=Commander, use these CLEAVER DRONES to distract GDI before attacking their base. These robotic vehicles are armed with reinforced blades capable of cutting flesh and armor alike. In addition, their advanced propulsion system renders them immune to Ion Storms.
181=WARNING! Approaching GloboTech convoy detected!
;;;Nod 11th;;;
182=Welcome to Lazarus, our main cybernetics facility. Most of our cyborgs and drones are manufactured and prepared for combat here.
183=Our scouts have informed us that GDI has established a staging area and several outposts nearby in an attempt to stop our cyborg production. Eliminate GDI's presence before it's too late.
184=We were also informed that GDI is now armed with EMP technology capable of disabling any mechanical units.
185=Notice that we're linking a cyborg commando, the CYBORG PALADIN, to our AI system. He'll be assisting you once the process is finished.
186=Commander, you should take a look at this!
187=The Cyborg Paladin has gone berserk! Stop him, before he causes too much damage to the facility!
188=GDI has an EMP CANNON on this ledge. Capture it and disable the Paladin with it! If that fails, there's no other choice but to eliminate him.
189=Well done, Commander! Lure the Paladin within firing-range of the EMP Cannon after it has recharged.
190=Objective 1: Destroy all GDI forces.
191=Objective 2: Capture the GDI EMP Cannon and use it to disable the Cyborg Paladin.
192=Objective 3: Eliminate the Cyborg Paladin.
;;;Combat Triangle;;;
193=HERESY! You will DIE!!!
;;;GDI covert op 4;;;
194=There have been reports of intense seismic pulses and atmospheric flares originating from this region. The area is tectonically stable, so we have reason to suspect Nod is behind them. Your mission is to locate and identify the source of the phenomena.
195=EVA: Nod salvage team detected.
196=The Nod cell scattered around the mountains is specialized in psychological warfare, which makes them unpredictable. We sent a small team ahead to scout the area, but they returned dazed and hypnotized, with no recollection of their mission. Be prepared for anything, Commander.
197=Goliath Pilot: Once you're in-country, you can never go home...
198=GDI Soldier: Sir, there's a large Nod base in the mountains. We're going to need reinforcements.
199=EVA: MCV en-route from the south.
200=Objective 1: Investigate Nod activity.
201=Objective 2: Capture the Nod Radar Array.
202=Objective 3: Destroy the Chronosphere immediately.
203=GDI Soldier: Sir, if we capture the Nod Radar in the base, we can use it to pinpoint the source of the signals.
204=EVA: Nod Radar captured & satellite uplink established. Objective complete.
205=Locating source of signal pulses, stand by...
206=Source located.
207=GDI Soldier: Holy shit! That's a Chronosphere, from the last Great War!
208=The Chronosphere appears highly unstable. If Nod manages to activate it once more, it could cause catastrophic side-effects. Destroy it immediately before it has time to recharge!
209=Commander, it appears the rumours of mind control are true. The GloboTech forces are fighting for Nod!
210=We're detecting strange signals coming from those towers around the GloboTech outpost. Destroy them, and the GloboTech forces might regain their senses.
211=GloboTech Guardian: Thank you, sir. I'm...not sure what happened, but I feel normal again. The city garrison is in your debt. Let us aid you in your mission!
212=
;;;Nod 11th continued;;;
213=Cyborg Paladin disabled, mission accomplished.
214=Cyborg Paladin eliminated, mission accomplished.
215=Damn it, the plan has failed! Now there's no other choice but to eliminate him.
216=
217=Nod Follower: This is not Kane's Legacy...
;;;Nod 12th;;;
218=Sir, the insurgency has the facility in total chaos! The underground facilities are now under dissident control and have been turned against us!
219=Since we're also being pursued by those GDI dogs, there's a very real chance we'll lose this vital technology unless we withdraw now.
220=This train contains everything needed to continue the program. We need to get it to the other part of the facility.
221=But there's a problem: The track leading there has been destroyed. We need to repair it in order to escort the train through the area!
222=Objective 1: Secure and repair the damaged track section.
223=Objective 2: Escort the train to safety.
224=Good job, Commander! The blueprints are safe for now.
225=Train engineer: Help! We're under attack!
226=Nod Machinist: Alright, we're ready to go!
;;;Nod 13th;;;
227=Sir, the facility is still threatened by this "Sons of Kane". We need to evacuate as fast as possible!
228=Defend the evacuation process at all costs. Don't let the enemy near our technicians or trucks -- otherwise our cyborg program will be lost forever!
229=Keep our ... former brothers ... out of the facility. Good luck, Commander.
230=Objective 1: Defend the evacuation process.
231=Shit, seems like it didn't take long for GDI to trace us! The situation is starting to look hopeless...
232=Too many evacuation personnel lost. Mission failed.
233=There are not enough Cyborgs to keep fighting these traitors off! We have to prove that this is Kane's vision as soon as possible!
234=This has to end! GDI is growing stronger! We'll never survive at this rate!
235=Sir, the evacuation process is finished. Everyone, get in the tunnels!
236=Where the hell are they all coming from!?
237=I didn't even realize Nod had this many followers!
238=Bomb Trucks!? That's not fair!
;;;GDI 14th 1/2;;;
239=Objective 2: Destroy the Nod walker prototype.
240=GDI Sniper: Hawkeye to base. I've located the target. The walker appears inactive but operational. Reporting a lot of activity in the Nod compound, over.
241=Commander, allowing the Brotherhood to continue experimenting with this new weapon could have disastrous consequences. Destroying it is your primary objective.
242=Unfortunately, the area is barely accessible for our ground forces and the facility boasts heavy anti-air defenses.
243=Our best approach is to establish a forward base on one of two Nod outposts south of their main facility.
244=We're providing you with an MCV and a small escort team. Proceed through the canyon to either one of the outposts. Good luck.
245=Objective 1: Take over one of the two Nod outposts.
246=Nod Outpost located.
247=Commander, Nod is aware of your presence and they've deployed the prototype walker. It appears to patrol the facility entrance, probably to intimidate and discourage a direct attack. See if you can use this opportunity to destroy it.
248=Well done Commander, the walker prototype is down.
249=ALERT! The Nod walker is approaching our base!
250=WARNING! We have ANOTHER walker inbound! This one's got cyborg infantry support.
251=Excellent work Commander. It looks like there are no more prototypes left.
;;; Nod 10th 2/3 ;;;
252=Commander, these are our new PHANTOM TANKS. These cloaked tank destroyers double as deployable artillery. Use them to bombard the GDI base defenses from a safe distance.
253=Machinists killed – mission failed.

265=GDI Soldier: Holy shit! Look at the size of that thing!
;;;GDI 10th;;;
266=Welcome to the Emerald Peak harvesting facility, Commander. As you can see, the base has suffered heavily from attacks by hostile Tiberian lifeforms.
267=The number of lifeforms in the area has grown exponentially during the last few weeks. We need your help fighting against these creatures.
268=It appears the lifeforms are massing in from the east, beyond the vein sea. Identify the source and neutralize it.
269=Objective 1: Defend the facility.
270=Objective 2: Investigate the source of the Tiberium lifeforms.
271=GDI Soldier: How come there are so many Nod squads patrolling the desert? They must be up to something.
272=Forget about the lifeforms, Commander! Nod has started a full-scale attack and we need your attention back at the base.
273=Huh? Reinforcements...? Wait...their transponders make no sense! Commander, those units were marked as MIA. What the hell...?
274=GloboTech Peacekeeper: What the fuck?! Why the hell is GDI attacking us?!
275=Warning! Nod has planted mines all over this area. We'll send you Mobile Sensor Vehicles, use them to detect any hidden Nod units.
276=It looks like the GloboTech facility's overrun, Commander. This won't be good for us...
;;;GDI 12th;;;
277=Warning! Incoming GloboTech forces detected!
278=Objective 1: Protect the convoy vehicles at all costs.
279=Commander! 10 convoys carrying the vital documents and machinery we reclaimed earlier are headed this way. Their destination is a base eight kilometers to the east.
280=The convoys are being pursued by GloboTech forces. You need to keep the convoy vehicles safe at all costs! We can't afford losing more than 20 of those vehicles.
281=An MCV is en route. Establish a base and protect the convoys as they pass through the area. Tiberium in the area is very limited, but there may be more resources on the other side of the canyon.
282=Convoy vehicle lost.
283=5 convoy vehicles lost.
284=10 convoy vehicles lost. Keep on fighting!
285=15 convoy vehicles lost.
286=20 convoy vehicles lost. We can't lose any more of them, Commander!
287=Too many convoy vehicles lost.
288=The 1st convoy is now arriving!
289=The next convoy is arriving.
290=The last convoy is arriving. We're almost there!
291=All of the convoys have passed. Great work, Commander. Soon we'll be back on our feet!
;;;GDI 11th;;;
292=It's an insurrection! The massacre at Emerald Peak has provoked GloboTech into taking over our facilities!
293=They have ordered their forces to confiscate the technology we jointly developed for the war against Nod.
294=We need to neutralize this new threat ASAP and reclaim what assets GloboTech forces have stolen. We need to re-assert our authority over this corporation.
295=An MCV is en route with an escort squad. Move to the nearby abandoned village to the north, clear the area and establish your base.
296=Objective 1: Establish a base.
297=Good work, Commander. We've located three GloboTech research laboratories in the area that are believed to contain most of the technology we're after.
298=Escort these three convoy trucks to the labs so that we can repossess the assets. The trucks must not be destroyed!
299=Objective 2: Escort the convoy trucks to the three GloboTech laboratories.
300=You may want to recapture our base from GloboTech, as the base lies nearby the southern laboratory and could be a threat to our transport trucks.
301=The second laboratory is located in GloboTech's base to the northeast and is heavily defended. Getting to this lab will require a large attack force.
302=The last laboratory is located to the north of your current location -- in the middle of the lake. We don't have further information on that lab at this time.
303=It looks like GloboTech has built a lakeside fort that is, at the moment, accessible only by train. We need to disable the defenses and access the lab from the inside.
304=We'll send you a COMMANDO. Get him onto this train, send him into the fort, and create an entrance for our ground forces by any means necessary.
305=Objective 3: Infiltrate the GloboTech fort and open access for vehicles.
306=GDI Commando: Alright, I'm in! Let's see what's in here.
307=GDI Commando: You! Repair that bridge or you won't see tomorrow!
308=GloboTech Engineer: Okay, okay..! Just don't hurt me!
309=The fort is now accessible. Now get the truck in there!
310=Convoy truck is in position.
311=All the trucks are now waiting for further orders. Great work, Commander! I honestly wasn't even sure if this was possible.
312=GloboTech Soldier: Shit, this train is filled with GDI troops! Shoot 'em!
313=Critical unit lost.
314=Critical structure lost.
315=Commander, these SUPER GOLIATHS are upgraded versions of our Goliath Tanks, equipped with railguns and superior armor. Caution is advised.

320=We have lost contact with the GDI airbase in this region. Head to the southwest, make contact with the airbase, and determine the fate of the airbase garrison.
321=GDI Manta pilot: Hey, over here! I almost got shot down by Nod SAM Bunkers, the area is littered with them! The airbase isn't responding to my SOS. What's going on?
322=WARNING: Nod CYBORGS detected. They are Tiberium-infused, mechanically augmented heavy infantry. Engaging them with your current forces is inadvisable.
323=Use the MANTA aircraft to neutralize the cyborgs. Its EMP cannon should freeze them long enough to allow your squad to pass by unharmed.
324=Airbase Guard: Look, reinforcements have arrived!
325=Well done, Commander. Looks like Nod was behind the blackout after all. Get the base back up and running so we can move on to your next objective.
326=The airbase recon has discovered a new type of Tiberium in the valley to the east. Unfortunately, Nod has already set up a harvesting facility in its vicinity.
327=It is probable that Nod attacked our airbase in order to conceal their operations. It is imperative you destroy their base and secure the Tiberium deposit.
328=Commander, it looks like the tunnel leading to the east has collapsed. There seems to be no other way in.
329=An MCV has arrived from the south. Use a CARRYALL to fly it across the ridge to the east and build a forward base there.
330=Commander, Nod has become aware of your presence. Prepare your defenses for an attack.
331=Prof. Higgs: So, this is the new Tiberium variant, yes? Fascinating, quite fascinating... Mhmm...
332=Excellent work, Commander! The Tiberium deposit is now under our control.

338=With his SMR.2 Mutation Rifle, he can turn any living being into a wonderously evolved Tiberium seraph!
339=There's a GloboTech safe haven for civilians inside this bunker. It's a perfect place to test the Infector's abilities. Send him in there, and leave no survivors! Our enemies will talk about today for the rest of their lives!
340=Dr. Incandela: I have taught the Infector the... delicate art of herding Tiberium lifeforms. Use his skills to your advantage.
341=Civilian: Wha..!? What's going on? Run! RUN, HONEY, RUN!

365=Objective 2: Assist the "Sons of Kane".
366=Sarajevo, home to our holiest temple, and the last known location of Kane, before the incident that reformed the entire region nearly 20 years ago. We believe the Temple contains evidence of Kane's cybernetic experiments.
367=We MUST acquire the logs in order to prove to the "Sons of Kane" that cybernetics really are vital to Kane's vision, and finally end this senseless conflict. Get your Ghost to the Temple and secure the files!
368=Your squad has been equipped with our new CYBORG REAPERS. Their twin ballistic missiles can cause significant damage to enemy structures and aircraft. Good luck, Commander!		;Unused!
369=Civilians: Nod cyborgs are coming! Someone tell the soldiers!
370=Ghost: Sir, the Temple is visible from here, but inaccessible due to the collapsed bridge. We need to head north and take a different route.
371=Ghost: Sir, I found the files! Transferring them now...
372=Excellent work, Commander. Our suspicions were correct, the files clearly indicate that Kane authorized the Cyborg program. Now we just need to... Huh..? Wait... Commander, we've picked up a distress call. The nearby rebel base is under GDI attack!
373=If you help them now, we can call a ceasefire, and that will give us opportunity to present our evidence. We'll send you an MCV. Establish a base and eradicate the GDI filth before they demolish that base!
374=That's it, Commander, the rebel base is lost...
375=Great work, Commander! The base survived the GDI attack. Now let's get those files to their leader...
376=Sons of Kane Leader: Do not assume this ceasefire to last - unless the information we heard you have is worth it.
377=Dr. Incandela: You should take a look at this. This is irrefutable proof of Kane's plans.
378=Sons of Kane Leader: How could we have been so BLIND? So this truly is Kane's legacy! Brothers, no longer shall we be separated. Let us unite against our one, true enemy. Down with GDI!
379=Dr. Incandela: Down with GDI!
380=What the hell are you doing, Commander?!
;;;Nod 15th;;;
381=Objective 1: Escort the MCV to our surveillance outpost.
382=Objective 2: Breach the outer Firestorm defences and capture the GDI warehouse.
383=Objective 3: Destroy the ICARUS modules.
384=Our nearby surveillance team is expecting you to escort this MCV to their outpost, Commander. Head northwest and assist the outpost in investigating GDI activity in the region.
385=It is imperative that you avoid being detected. Make sure you utilize our new SHADOW STEALTH TANKS, provided to us by the Sons of Kane. Good luck!
386=Shadow Pilot: Shh! Don't get too close to those Skimmers, or they might notice us.
387=Shadow Pilot: Shit, those GDI heretics have spotted us! I'd expect enemy reinforcements to arrive any time now.
388=Damn it! GDI have started deploying sensor vehicles in the area. We won't stay hidden for long.
389=MCV Operator: They've spotted me! I'm taking damage!
390=Outpost Officer: Good to see you here, Commander! Please do not deploy your MCV just yet. Our spies have gathered some critical information from the local villagers in regards to the facility.
391=Outpost Officer: The GDI facility entrance is fortified with FIRESTORM walls. Once they get activated, nothing goes in. We need to move carefully, otherwise they will detect us and activate those walls.
392=Outpost Officer: There's a warehouse behind the perimeter where we can find information on GDI command directives. However, they have deployed a SENSOR VEHICLE near the perimeter that will detect any of our stealthed units.
393=Outpost Officer: Also, we currently have very limited resources. The nearest accessible Tiberium field is located to the north, behind the facility's perimeter, so we'll have to utilize some clever tactics to get our harvesters there.
394=Outpost Officer: I suggest we destroy the Sensor Vehicle with our lightning fast BANSHEE INTERCEPTORS. GDI won't even know what hit them! Then sneak in with the Shadows and destroy the Firestorm Generator.
395=Outpost Officer: Finally, the MCV arrives! Huh..? What is this, Commander? You're being followed by GDI? We can't grant you access here, they'll find us too!
396=Machinist: The GDI Harvesters are amphibious -- we could utilize this ability to reach the Tiberium field south of the outpost.
397=Outpost Officer: Alright, the Sensor is down. You should be able to sneak into the facility with your Shadows now, Commander.
398=Outpost Officer: Yes, the perimeter is down! We should move in there ASAP and begin construction!
399=Machinist: I have some alarming news, Commander. It looks like GDI is developing a new Ion Cannon, called the ICARUS, in here. They're just getting ready to transport the satellite's modules to the launch site, and the launch date is in a few days.
400=Machinist: The modules are held in several warehouses located behind the facility's second perimeter, all protected by Firestorm defenses. They'll be transported in 45 minutes using 6 armored trucks.
401=We need to act fast, Commander! Build up your base and demolish those warehouses before the trucks can evacuate. We need to buy some time to gather enough forces to attack the launch site.
402=Module destroyed.
403=Commander, the trucks are leaving now and are heading for the facility's eastern exit. Destroy all of them!
404=Some of the trucks managed to escape your hands, Commander. This won't be good.
405=Great work, Commander. None of the modules survived and GDI will have to delay the launch. Now destroy the rest of the facility!
406=Objective 4: Destroy all GDI structures in the area.
;;;GDI 1 Intro;;;
407=The Tiberian War ended with a devastating defeat for the Global Defense Initiative. At first the war seemed in GDI's favor, with the Brotherhood of Nod losing ground at a steady pace. However, Nod gained the public support over GDI by manipulating global media.
408=The unthinkable happened when Nod managed to seize control of GDI's newly developed orbital Ion Cannon and used it to destroy the White House, framing GDI and effectively ending the war.
409=As a result of the tragedy, the United Nations was forced to suspend and investigate GDI's operations. Most of GDI's assets were subsequently lost during Nod's campaign to conquer the world.
410=Eventually the UN itself, along with many countries previously thought untouchable, were infiltrated by the Brotherhood. The future of the world looked grim.
411=Four years later, the UN has reached its verdict to disband GDI. A lone GDI colonel decides to stand up against the bureaucracy and restore GDI, as though a mighty phoenix rising from the ashes...
;;;GDI 15th;;;
412=Objective 1: Locate and capture the GloboTech outpost to the southwest.
413=Objective 2: Defend the base and the MAMMOTH WALKER.
414=Objective 3: Capture Nod's Construction Yard, Technology Center and Wraith Supply Facilities. DO NOT DESTROY THESE BUILDINGS!
415=Commander, we've discovered a Nod facility in this area. Our intel claims that they are developing a new type of aircraft they call the WRAITH. Your objective is to capture their Technology Center and any Wraith Supply Pads located in the facility, as well as their Construction Yard.
416=We're establishing a harbor base on this island. We've transported a prototype MAMMOTH WALKER to the base, and it's being prepared for battle as we speak. The walker is armed with powerful railguns and AA rockets, and will be our key element when attacking Nod's facility.
417=Resources on the island are very limited, so before we can attack we need to locate a richer source of Tiberium. Use this squad of EXO-SUIT INFANTRY to scout the area and locate a larger Tiberium field. Avoid any Nod forces -- we don't want them to be aware of our presence just yet.
418=Exo-Suit: I suggest we head southwest. There's an abandoned GloboTech outpost there that used to monitor the toxic levels of a nearby Tiberium field. We could capture the outpost and build a refinery there.
419=Exo-Suit: Damn, the bridges have collapsed. I'm sure the GloboTech outpost is on the other side. Let's head north and see if we can find another way.
420=ENGINEER: Shit, shit, shit! This building's packed with visceroids!
421=Civilian: Brace yourselves, the floaters are coming!
422=Civilian: Thank you soldiers, we owe you one.
423=Exo-Suit: Look, the Tiberium field is down there. The outpost must be near.
424=Incinerator: Well well well, look what the cat dragged in.
425=Exo-Suit: Damn you Noddies! We'll never talk!
426=Incinerator: Such spite! We just wanted to thank you for bringing your secret weapon right at our doorstep!
427=Exo-Suit: How did you...?
428=Incinerator: Don't worry. We'll make a good use of that Mammoth once we have taken over your base. Goodbye!
429=Damn it! Nod's aware of our presence, but we can't back down now. Defend the base and the MAMMOTH until it's ready for combat.
430=You're still low on resources. We can't defend ourselves for much longer if you don't capture that GloboTech outpost soon.
431=The MAMMOTH is finally ready for combat! Attack the Nod facility and capture the mission-critical buildings.
432=Exo-Suit: Be careful! Those things could've killed you! You civilians should stay indoors when those creeps are crawling out there.
433=Outstanding, Commander, now get your economy running.
434=Exo-Suit: These mutants are getting weirder by the day.
;;;GDI 13th 2/2;;;
435=We need to establish a base on the archipelago, Commander. Use your forces to get rid of all the GloboTech structures on these islands, including their research buildings and laboratories.
436=The Globotech equipment that we retrieved earlier is available now thanks to your efforts. We have put the PHALANX into production. It is armed with a powerful railgun accelerator capable of engaging both ground and air targets. Deploy the unit to switch to its AA mode.
437=Shit. GloboTech is using their EMP batteries to make this a no-fly zone. There must be a massive power source that's keeping those defenses up -- something like that should be easy to locate.
438=We've located the power source. Its coordinates are now visible in your radar. Destroy the reactor to shut down the turrets and get our aircraft off the ground again.
439=Objective 1: Destroy all GloboTech structures on the archipelago.
440=Objective 2: Shut down GloboTech's main power source.
441=It has come to our attention that GloboTech has deployed several EMP sea mines around the archipelago. These mines will hinder our amphibious and hovering vehicles.
442=GloboTech Drone: Enemy presence detected. Entering self-destruct mode.
443=Seems that GloboTech is trying to slow down our movement by destroying those bridges. Get an ENGINEER to repair them so your troops can advance.
444=Can you hear that, Commander? They're probably blowing up all the bridges leading to their main island. The only way in there will be by air transport. Shut down their reactor so we can bring in troops off the dropships.
445=GloboTech Fusion Reactor destroyed, defensive turrets offline.
446=GloboTech Fusion Reactor re-routed, defensive turrets offline.
447=Yes! Well done, Commander. We'll deploy an attack force to the main island. Use your CARRY-ALLS to bring in reinforcements. Destroy their final stronghold!
448=GloboTech C.O.O. Conan Steele: That's enough, Commander! There have been enough casualties already... We surrender...
449=GloboTech Drone: Enemy presence detected. Self-destructing in 3... 2... 1...
450=GDI Soldier: Sir! It might be beneficial to capture that GloboTech Expansion Outpost and establish a resource base on this island.
;;;Nod Campaign Intro;;;
451=The First Tiberian War came to an abrupt end with Nod capturing GDI's South African Ion Cannon relay center. With a single use of the weapon, Nod destroyed not just the White House, but also any credibility GDI might still have possessed as a counter-force.
452=Yet, though the Brotherhood now reigned triumphant over most of the world, opposition movements still existed that did everything they could to stop Nod's actions.
453=Most of these agitators were unorganized and stood no chance against the Brotherhood's growing power. Nod leadership consequently prioritized the destruction of GDI's few remaining bases to cement the Brotherhood's victory.
454=Now, however, the Inner Circle has become aware of a new threat. One that, if left alone, might become a major counter-weight to the Brotherhood...
;;;Nod 9th additions;;;
455=Dr. Incandela: The rest of the civilians have locked themselves behind that gate. Turn the guards and send them to kill the rest!
;;;Nod 2nd 3/3;;;

457=Civilian: It's... All is lost...
458=Nod Soldier: Have you guys noticed that visceroids are getting more and more common these days? I just saw one last week.
;;;Nod 14th additions;;;
459=Ghost: I'm under fire, do something!
;;;Nod 10th additions;
460=Well done, Commander. Now GDI won't be able to communicate with GloboTech when the storm passes. Capture the rest of the base and attack GloboTech with GDI's equipment.
461=Oh, I see you prefer more... overt tactics. That works just as well, now GDI won't be able to communicate with GloboTech when the storm passes. Capture the rest of the base and attack GloboTech with GDI's equipment.
;;;Nod 15th additions;;;
462=Destroying that power relay seems to have cut power from those two turrets at the facility entrance. GDI must've noticed this. Move your MCV past the entrance while you can!
463=That's some good thinking, Commander -- exploiting the turret's weakness. GDI must've noticed that the turret has been destroyed, move your MCV past the entrance while you can!
464=Once achieved, we should be able to access the facility with our MCV and Cyborgs, and capture the warehouse.
;;;Nod 5 additions;;;
467=Be warned, Commander. GloboTech have constructed EMP Missile Batteries around the facility. These are lethal to aircraft, but require power to remain operational. Perhaps their power source is somewhere around the supply base...
;;;GDI 3B;;;
468=General Sheppard: Thank you for your assistance, Commander. There is an abandoned GDI airfield nearby. It seems to be the only suitable landing zone within hundreds of miles of our location.
469=General Sheppard: Unfortunately, Nod has set up a base in the area and is salvaging supplies from the base. We need to clear those Nod forces out, so that we can reach the evac point safely. 
470=General Sheppard: These are our prototype SKIMMERS. They're highly versatile vehicles equipped with anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles. Use them to scout out the airbase and clear us a path.

481=An Obelisk of Light is offline. 
482=Skimmer Pilot: Sir, I think these reactors may be the power source of the Obelisks.
483=GDI Ranger: Damn, we're too late! There's another way to the airbase, General. We'll get you there!
484=General Sheppard: Damn! They blew the only bridge to the airbase, and have started setting up defenses. We should move fast. An MCV is en-route to the southwest.
485=WARNING! Nod reinforcements en route!

494=With the train, we can transport our Machinist through GDI's defense line and to our abandoned facility. Capture the facility's CONSTRUCTION YARD so we may re-establish control. When this is done, you should defend against GDI forces and wait for reinforcements.
495=Unfortunately, GDI has barricaded the city with a Firestorm Wall. The wall's generator should be located nearby --- it must be destroyed for us to get to the train.
496=Scout the area with your Shadows and deactivate the wall so your attack force can access the city, and secure the area around the train. Make sure your Machinist survives long enough to capture the Construction Yard.
497=Watch out, Commander. GDI has deployed several sensor vehicles in the area. To get past them with your Shadows, create a diversion or find another route around them.
498=Shadow Pilot: Sir, we've spotted the Firestorm Generator. The bridge leading to it is poorly defended -- we could sneak in from there.
499=Shadow Pilot: The Firestorm defenses have been deactivated.  Attack force is a go.

508=Critical building lost!
509=Support airstrike inbound.
510=Commander, our efforts to prevent GDI from launching ICARUS have failed, and the new Ion Cannon is now operational. Fortify your base ASAP and construct a new TEMPLE OF NOD in the area. The Temple is armed with our new APOCALYPSE MISSILES -- use them to your advantage.
511=Nod reinforcements have arrived from the northwest.
512=Nod reinforcements have arrived from the northeast.
513=Commander, this is General Owen's COMMAND CENTER. Before we can attack the building we must establish a strong base in the area by recapturing and reinforcing the nearby Sons of Kane facility.
514=The facility was overtaken and is heavily guarded by GDI, and taking their defences down will require a large attack force. The best place to start is to steal an ARMORED GDI TRAIN that our scouts have located in a city near the facility.
515=Commander, use our new WRAITH BOMBERS against GDI. They are armed with devastating Tiberium-based plasma bombs.
516=Our forces in north have succesfully established footholds in the area, Commander. Now concentrate all your efforts in destroying the MAMMOTH production facility and General Owen's COMMAND CENTER.
517=Watch out, Commander, GDI have begun deploying their MAMMOTH WALKERS!
518=Penetrating the GDI fortress from the outside is proving to be difficult, Commander. Our scanners have just analyzed the structure of the fortress and found a possible weak spot.
519=GDI has left the ground here unpaved. Fools! Use our TERMITE APCs and TREMOR ARTILLERY to burrow inside the GDI base and de-activate the Firestorm defences.

1051=Globotech Representative: "I'll head out now to avoid suspicion from the UN.  You'll have to make it there on your own. Good luck, I'll be expecting you there soon."
